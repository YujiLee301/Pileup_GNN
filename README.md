# Pileup_GNN

**Datasets**
The raw datasets are stored in the `/datasets` folder with the `prepare_dataset.py` to generate graph for each event.
- fast simulation datasets are the dataset from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.07988.pdf)
- `/fast_simulation` directory contains the files to train the models and test on fast simulation dataset in GGNN.
- `/real_simulation` directory contains the files to train the models and test on real simulation dataset. 

**Dependencies**
- Python ==3.8
- Torch  ==1.7.1
- numpy ==1.20.1
- torch_geometric == 1.6.3
